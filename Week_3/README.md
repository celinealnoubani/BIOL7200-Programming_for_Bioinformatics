# Week 3: Advanced Shell Scripting with BLAST

## Topics Covered
- Advanced BLAST analysis
- Filtering and parsing BLAST output
- Perfect hit identification
- Shell scripting for sequence analysis pipelines

## Exercise Overview
Building on Week 2's BLAST introduction, this week focuses on more complex filtering criteria and result analysis for identifying significant sequence matches.

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `perfect.hits` | Filtered perfect BLAST matches |
| `week3_data.tar.gz` | Input sequence data |

## Key Concepts

### BLAST Output Analysis
- Parsing tabular BLAST output (format 6)
- Filtering by percent identity and alignment length
- Identifying biologically significant matches

### Shell Pipeline Techniques
- Chaining commands with pipes
- Using awk for column-based filtering
- Sorting and counting results

## Learning Outcomes
- Design complex BLAST filtering criteria
- Process BLAST results for downstream analysis
- Build reproducible analysis pipelines in bash
